    <h2>Google unveils Gemini CLI, an open-source AI tool for terminals</h2>
    <p>Gemini CLI is part of Google’s efforts to get developers using its AI models in their coding workflows. Since Google launched Gemini 2.5 Pro in April, the company’s AI models have become a favorite among developers. While AI coding tools are rising rapidly in popularity, using them comes with risks. Several studies have shown that code-generating AI models can occasionally introduce errors or fail to fix security vulnerabilities.

    <h2>Ring cameras and doorbells now use AI to provide specific descriptions of motion activity</h2>
    <p>Contact Us Amazon-owned Ring announced on Wednesday that it’s introducing a new AI-powered feature to its doorbells and cameras, which offers users specific text descriptions of current motion activity. Now, users will be able to know exactly what is happening and can quickly decide whether it requires immediate attention. Additionally, Siminoff mentioned that Ring will “learn your routine,” so it can inform users when something is out of the ordinary. This announcement follows the recent launch of Ring’s AI-powered search feature, which enables users to locate specific moments within video recordings.

    <h2>Kodiak is using Vay’s remote driving tech in its self-driving trucks</h2>
    <p>The technology is often used to support sidewalk delivery robots, low speed autonomous shuttles, and even self-driving forklifts. Kodiak says its employees, all of whom have commercial driving licenses and undergo rigorous training, use Vay’s system to operate the self-driving trucks in low-speed scenarios, such as if the truck were to encounter a complex construction zone with law enforcement making hand signals. Wendel told TechCrunch Kodiak began investigating remote-driving technology when it was awarded a contract by the U.S. Army in 2022. “No matter the maturity of an autonomous driving system, there are still scenarios that will benefit from human assistance, if only as a backup,” he said.

    <h2>Julie Bornstein’s Daydream is releasing an AI-powered chatbot for fashion-related shopping</h2>
    <p>People can sign up for the chatbot, which will ask them their name, birthdate, price range they shop in, and brand preferences, if any. The web app also shows you daily inspiration for items and accessories that possibly match your taste. She said that traditional search only showed shoppers items based on tags matching their keywords, which doesn’t work in today’s world, where customers are asking longer queries. We are also using image visual recognition to satisfy detailed queries where a customer describes the exact product they want,” Belousova said.

    <h2>New space startup Lux Aeterna wants to make satellites reusable</h2>
    <p>The Denver-based company, which is coming out of stealth today, has designed a reusable satellite called Delphi that it aims to launch — and land — in 2027. Founder and CEO Brian Taylor said the idea for Lux Aeterna came to him last year while he watched his former employer, SpaceX, launch one of its Starship test vehicles into space. Size matters for people who build satellites and other spacecraft, since they’re often working backwards from the simple constraint of what can fit inside a rocket’s cargo area. And Starship is not alone — there are other heavy-lift rockets in the works, too, like Blue Origin’s New Glenn.

    <h2>How Synthflow AI is cutting through the noise in a loud AI voice category</h2>
    <p>Berlin-based Synthflow is a no-code platform that lets enterprises build and deploy customized white-labeled voice AI customer service agents. The company grew 15x last year and has seen over 90% retention from its enterprise customers, according to Astabatsyan. What stood out to Bocchio was the founding team’s drive and its early push into building enterprise-friendly integrations. “AI is moving so fast, and sometimes things happen faster than you would expect,” Astabatsyan said.

    <h2>Russia frees REvil hackers after sentencing</h2>
    <p>﻿The ransomware group members evaded a five-year prison stint due to time served. Four members of the REvil ransomware group have been released from custody despite pleading guilty to fraud and malware distribution charges. The Dzerzhinsky Court of St. Petersburg allowed Roman Muromsky, Andrei Bessonov, Mikhail Golovachuk, and Dmitry Korotaev to walk free after sentencing them to five years in prison on Monday, ruling that the gang members had spent enough time in a Russian detention center while awaiting trial. This includes “carding,” a form of fraud and laundering that involves using stolen credit card information to buy prepaid gift cards. It is not currently believed that any of them have been, or will be, extradited to the US.</p>

    <h2>Google is bringing Gemini CLI to developers&#8217; terminals</h2>
    <p>Google has launched a new open-source AI agent that brings Gemini’s coding, content generation, and research capabilities directly into developers’ terminals. “While it excels at coding, we built Gemini CLI to do so much more. It’s a versatile, local utility you can use for a wide range of tasks, from content generation and problem solving to deep research and task management.” Gemini CLI utilizes Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro reasoning model, which currently supports a 1 million token context window (the amount of information that an AI model can understand). Gemini CLI is available for developers to preview starting today, and it’s currently free to use through a free Gemini Code Assist license that can be obtained via a personal Google account. That provides Gemini CLI users with a usage limit of 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day, which Google says is the “largest allowance” offered across the industry.</p>

    <h2>Ring camera alerts are about to get a lot smarter</h2>
    <p>Ring is adding AI-powered descriptions of motion activity to its camera and video doorbell notifications. Ring is adding AI-powered descriptions of motion activity to its camera and video doorbell notifications. This would “generate alerts only when something happens on your property that is an anomaly,” he said, explaining that Ring will be able to learn the routines of your home and only deliver notifications when something out of the ordinary happens. For example, the extra context text descriptions provide could be used by a gen-AI service like Alexa Plus to enable other actions in your home. While detailed text descriptions of activity make it easier for people to keep an eye on their property, they also make it easier to keep track of people in a home, which could be abused by unscrupulous users.</p>

    <h2>HDMI 2.2 will support 16K video at 60Hz</h2>
    <p>Hardware makers can start building HDMI 2.2-compatible devices and cables with bandwidths up to 96Gbps. Hardware makers can start building HDMI 2.2-compatible devices and cables with bandwidths up to 96Gbps. HDMI 2.1 and the current Ultra High Speed HDMI cables have a maximum bandwidth of 48Gbps which supports resolutions up to 10K and refresh rates up to 120Hz with 4K content. The HDMI Forum is also hoping that the new specification will make it easier for consumers to know what cable they need to be using. The feature is designed to build on audio and video synchronization improvements introduced with HDMI 2.1, particularly for setups where signals are bouncing through a soundbar or an AV receiver before reaching a TV or projector.</p>

    <h2>The smaller Fairphone 6 introduces swappable accessories</h2>
    <p>﻿The repairable smartphone is now even more modular with new accessories that expand its functionality. Fairphone has announced its latest repairable smartphone, nearly two years after introducing the last upgrade. The new Fairphone 6 is smaller and 9 percent lighter than its predecessor, but it includes a larger 4,415mAh battery — easily replaceable by removing just seven screws — that will power the phone for up to 53 hours on a full charge. That’s a significant step down from the Fairphone 5, which used 50MP sensors on all three of its cameras. Repairability is still a priority for Fairphone, and its new phone carries forward the same modular design of past versions.</p>

    <h2>Veloretti just made one of the best e-bikes lighter and cheaper</h2>
    <p>The step-over Ace Two Lite is a lighter and less expensive version of the very heavy Ace Two e-bike I reviewed back in 2023, which ditches the sublime Enviolo automatic shifter in favor of a simpler single-speed, belt-driven transmission. It’s being sold alongside the step-through Ivy Two Lite for €2,599. I should note that the Lite models aren’t exactly lightweight. I’d have preferred that Veloretti ditched its overwrought integrated display, but it lives to fight another day. The Ace Two Lite is available in graphite or matte black, while the Ivy Two Lite is only available in matte black.</p>
